# Audio

1. Need to replace Oto version 1.0.1 with Ebitengine built-in audio handler.
This is problematic because oto uses a writer which handles over and under runs
in a way, but I cannot get ebitengine to do the same.

2. Need to fix pitch and volume of the analog channels, particularly volume of
WAVE and pitch of NOISE.
