# ðŸ¥‘ Guac GBA/GBA/DMG Emulator

Guac is an Emulator written in golang for Gameboy, Gameboy Color and Gameboy
Advance handheld consoles.

# Getting Started

## Command line

Run the executable with a rom path (gb, gbc, and gba are required extensions) to
immediately enter the game.

```
.\guac -r="../rom/pokemon_emerald.gba"
```

## Console Mode

Run the executable without flags to use console mode, which initalizes a Game
Selection Screen.

```
.\guac
```

### Setting up Console Mode

In the same directory as ./guac, create a "roms.json" file. This file will hold
the game metadata in the following format. At this time Art **MUST** be pngs.

```
[
 {
  "Name": "The Minish Cap",
  "RomPath": "./rom/gba/the_minish_cap.gba",
  "ArtPath": "./art/the_minish_cap.png",
  "Year": 2005,
  "Console": "Gameboy Advance"
 },
 ...]
 ```
